# what-halachic-day
A project toward resolving the personal issue of "what is today's halachic date?"
Sometimes, specifically days like Rosh Hodesh, it's just too hard to know whether it "falls tonight" or currently is today. Therefore I have endeavored to make a pet project to resolve this. It may be extremely simple, or, complicated. As time goes on we'll have to see.
